---

Breast cancer was documented even before ancient Greece, with the first ever record being

documented on a papyrus dating back to 2500 BCE (Goldman). Actual medical diagnosis of

breast cancer was not until the renaissance in the 1700s, where John Hunter from Scotland

identified lymphs as causes of breast cancer (Thomas).


### **Main Treatments of Breast Cancer in the 19th Century**
Common method of treating breast cancer in the 19th century are as follows:

  - **Lumpectomy:** Surgical removal of tumor where only the tumor tissue is removed

  - including the surrounding breast tissue. This type of surgery was also known as breast

  - conserving surgery as it left most of the breast tissue intact. However, many patients

  - required radiation therapy afterwards to prevent reemergence of cancer (Goldman).

● **Mastectomy:** Complete removal of the breast tissue in which cancer cells have

proliferated, including the nipple, areola, and skin. Additional removal of lymph nodes in

the under arm was also conducted, known as radical mastectomy which was first done

by William Halsted in 1882, as it was known from the 1700s that tumors originated from

lymph nodes (Thomas).



● **Radiation Therapy:** Destruction of cancer cells by specifically targeting areas on the

breast tissue with X-ray. First conducted in 1937 along with mastectomy and steadily

proved to show great effects. It was later found out that short specific treatments of

radiation therapy resulted in equal effects to that of long term therapy, increasing patient

mortality (Goldman).



**Drug Treatments of the late 20th century**

In addition to surgeries that were being modified overtime in the 19th century, different drugs

were also introduced in the late 20th century that targeted specific receptors and hormones.

Most notable drugs include:

● **Tamoxifen:** Introduced in 1978 as an anti-estrogen drug to prevent development of

breast cancer. Known as the first in a new class of drugs called selective estrogen

receptor modulators (SERM). In 1998 Tamoxifen is found to decrease risk of developing

breast cancer in women by 50% and is approved by FDA to be used as preventive

therapy (Goldman)

● **Anastrozole**: Approved in 1996 to blocks production of estrogen

● **Herceptin:** Also approved by FDA in 1998 which targets cancer cells that are

over-producing HER2

● **Raloxifene:** Found in 2006 as SERM drug to reduce breast cancer risk for

postmenopausal women and has lower chance of serious side effects compared to

Tamoxifen
