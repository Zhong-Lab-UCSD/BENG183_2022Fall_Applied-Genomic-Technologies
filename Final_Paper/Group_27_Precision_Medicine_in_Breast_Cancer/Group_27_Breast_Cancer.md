**Precision Medicine on Breast Cancer**

**1. Overview of disease**

Breast cancer refers to tumors that originate in breast tissue, which is the most common type of

cancer in women. Causes of breast cancer are the following but not limited to:

● Mutations to certain genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 → Downstream effect on DNA

repair, Transcription regulation, ubiquitination cycle, chromatin structure regulation, cell

cycle regulation

● Exposure to therapeutics such as diethylstilbestrol (DES) or radiation therapy

● Old age (>50)

● Obesity

● Smoking

**Symptoms of breast cancer include:**

● Change in size, shape or contour of breast

● A mass/lump, as small as a pea

● A lump/thickening in or near breast on in underarm

● Change in look or feel of skin on breast or nipple

● Redness of skin

● Blood-stained or clear fluid discharge from nipple

Just like other types of cancers, different stages of breast cancer are determined based on the

location, size, and the rate of spreading of the cancer cells:

**○ Stage 0**

■ This stage disease is non-invasive and localized within the breast ducts

**○ Stage I.**

■ At this stage of the disease, the cancer cells started to spread to the

nearby breast tissue. Yet, the survival rate is very high.

**○ Stage II.**

■ Stage II is still a smaller size tumor, relatively 2 to 5 centimeters across

and may or may not affect the nearby lymph nodes.

**○ Stage III.**

■ This is the beginning of the spreading away from the cancer’s point of

origin. If the cancer has started from the breast ducts, then it can have

invaded nearby lymph nodes and tissue. Often Stage III cancer is also

known as locally advanced breast cancer.

**○ Stage I V.**

■ This stage of breast cancer is also known as metastatic breast cancer.

Metastasis means that the cancer has spread to different areas away

from the breast tissue like to the lungs, brain, bones, or etc.





There are also numerous different types of breast cancer, which includes the following:

● **Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS):** noninvasive abnormal cells inside the milk ducts

● **Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)**: cancer cell originated in the milk-producing glands

called lobules

● **Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC):** a kind of breast cancer that does not have any

receptors that are commonly found in breast cancer

○ estrogen receptors

○ progesterone receptors

○ HER2 receptors

● **Inflammatory breast cancer:** rare and aggressive breast cancer where cancer cells

block lymph vessels

● **Paget’s disease of breast:** usually starts in the nipple where the skin also shows

eczema-like symptoms in that region

● **Angiosarcoma:** cancer that forms in lining of blood vessels and lymph vessels

● **Phyllodes tumors of the breast:** rare tumors that start in connective tissue of the

breast and most of these are benign





**2. Breast Cancer: Therapies and Treatments in the Past**

Breast cancer was documented even before ancient Greece, with the first ever record being

documented on a papyrus dating back to 2500 BCE (Goldman). Actual medical diagnosis of

breast cancer was not until the renaissance, where John Hunter from Scotland identified lymphs

as causes of breast cancer (Goldman).

**Main Treatments of Breast Cancer in the 18th Century**

More common method of treating breast cancer in the 18th century

● lumpectomies done to surgically remove tumor → breast conserving surgery

● radical mastectomy done by William Halsted in 1882 → used until into the 20th century

○ mastectomy removes breast tissue including nipple, areola, and skin but not

lymph nodes while radical mastectomy removes the entire breast including the

underarm lymph nodes

● in 1895 x ray is taken and used as mammograms to detect breast cancer

● radiation therapy is used in addition to surgery to spare the breast in 1937

● tamoxifen introduced in 1978 → anti estrogen drug , first in a new class of drugs called

selective estrogen receptor modulators

● anastrozole approved in 1996 → blocks production of estrogen

● in 1998 tamoxifen is found to decrease risk of developing breast cancer in women by

50% and is approved by FDA to be used as preventive therapy

● in 1998 Herceptin is also approved by FDA → targets cancer cells that are

over-producing HER2

● in 2006 raloxifene SERM drug is found to reduce breast cancer risk for postmenopausal

women and has lower chance of serious side effects compared to tamoxifen

● in 2013, four major subtypes of breast cancer are defined as HR+/HER2 (luminal A),

HR-/HER2 (triple negative), HR+/HER2+ (luminal B) and HR-/HER2+ (HER2 enriched)

● in 2017 Ogivri (biosimilar) is approved by FDA for treatment → copies of biologic drugs

and cost less than branded drugs

● in 2019 Enhertu is approved by the FDA, which proves to be very effective in treating

HER2 positive breast cancer that’s metastasized or can’t be removed with surgery

● in 2020 Trodelvy is approved by FDA for treating metastatic triple negative breast cancer

for people who haven’t responded to at least two other treatments

**Treatment for breast cancer**

● before 1970: all underwent removal of ovaries - no estrogen, no growth of the tumor →

helped only 70% of patients with ER(estrogen receptor) + tumors

● 1970: 70% of breast cancer are ER positive. These patients can be treated with

anti-estrogen agents to block cancer growth

● 1984: 20% of breast cancers have abnormal HER-2 gene expression. New drug,

Herceptin is developed to inhibit the function of this protein.

● mid 1990s: 5% of breast cancers have inherited defects in gene BRCA1 or BRCA2. No

preventive treatment but can screen for such inborn defects and watch for tumor

formation





**3. Genomics in Breast Cancer Classification and Treatments Today**

What is **Precision Medicine**?

○ <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQKFgfMO5Sw>.

○ Collect data on health, disease, environmental factors, family history and such

and perform intersectional analysis to create best treatment for patients with

specific criterias for a specific disease rather than singular common treatment for

all patients with that disease.

**Precision Oncology:** Using a cancer’s genomic makeup to determine treatment

methods rather than focusing on symptoms of “average” cancer

**● Older Focus**

○ Based on tumor size, tumor grade (how they look compared to normal cells), and

axillary lymph nodes (buildups of cells in lymph system)

(“Staging & Grade”)

○ Tumor size is easy to quantify, but tumor grade is subjective especially if tumor is

heterogenous

○ Axillary lymph nodes have a weak correlation with cancer metastasis: 30%

without will develop metastasis in a decade while 50% were cured with only a

local treatment

**● Modern Approach**

○ Categorize with Genomics

■ Use various bioinformatic techniques to learn more

○ Early studies have determined multiple categories





○ 3 major categories of breast cancer based on gene expression abnormalities:

■ Hormone receptor (HR) expressing (either estrogen receptor (ER+) or

progesterone receptor (PR+) expressing) 70% in developed countries

■ Human epidermal receptor expressing (HER2+) 20%

■ Triple negative (ER-, PR-, HER2-), further divided into 6 categories 10%

○ Various combinations of ER, PR and HER2 expressing all have different

treatment approaches

● HR+ (ER+/PR-, ER-/PR+, ER+/PR+) indicates that hormone receptors are abnormally

expressed in the cancer cells, indicating that the cancer is using the hormones to grow.

○ Target the cancer by blocking production of the specific hormone (ER or PR) or

blocking hormone receptors (Dedhia)

(Dedhia)

● HER2 is a protein that promotes cell growth. HER2+ cancers grow and spread more

quickly than HER2- cancers (Lynne).

○ Immunotherapy: target the proteins binding sites with antibodies to prevent them

protein binding

(Lynne)

● Triple Negatives: have a cancer phenotype while being ER-, PR- and HER2-:

○ Difficult to classify/treat due to low prevalence and unknown mechanisms

○ Use more general cancer treatments to deal with the cancers
