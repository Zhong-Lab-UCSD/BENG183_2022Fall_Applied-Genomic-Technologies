## Background
Although numerous breakthroughs in medicine have significantly advanced the field and overall improved both quality and duration of life, medicine has traditionally followed a one-size-fits-all approach that aimed to be the most efficacious for the most number of people. Patients diagnosed with the same diseases received identical treatment without regard for unique individual factors because, until recently, creating targeted treatments for each individual has not been possible. 

Advances in technology have paved the path for an alternative approach to medicine which involves analyzing disease at a genetic level. This allows researchers to develop more personalized therapeutics, treatments, diagnoses, and dosages according to individual  gene profiles, environmental factors, and lifestyles (FDA). Developments in technology and the bioinformatics field have allowed for the creation of patient databases and information hubs that allow for the curation of medical treatments personalized to the individual level.

By tailoring treatments to the patients that receive them, therapeutics have become much more effective, ushering in a new era of medicine deemed *precision medicine*.

## Current Methods
The modern Information Age has enabled researchers to employ a variety of strategies to examine personal health factors. For example, family health history can offer critical insight into health risks and aid in preventative care. Additionally, personal health tracking devices, such as Fitbit or Apple Watch devices, can provide information about an individual's day-to-day fitness, activities, and vitals (CDC).

The most significant tool of precision medicine is genome sequencing, which allows researchers to examine specific genetic causes of disease. Next generation sequencing, or NGS, is the most common method of doing so (CDC), the process of which is outlined in the figure below.

By identifying specific genetic causes, researchers are able to develop specific therapeutics in response which will actively target the cause and thus more effectively treat it.

Additionally, biomarker testing provides a useful strategy for developing personalized cancer treatment. In biomarker testing, a sample of cancer cells is analyzed for tumor markers, which are unique to each cancer and can help with diagnosis and monitoring (NIH). Based on the biomarkers present, doctors can determine the appropriate and most effective treatment.

Lastly, pharmacogenomics studies how an individual's DNA affects their response to drug treatment, allowing health care professionals to implement and adjust medicinal regimens as needed (CDC).

As biotechnology and medicine continues to develop, the methods of precision medicine will undoubtedly also continue to expand and pioneer paths of more personalized and therefore effective treatment.


## Applications
Precision medicine has numerous applications, particularly for treatment and prevention.
### Treatment
Treatment has seen a strong development in oncology due to precision medicine, specifically in comprehensive genomic profiling, or CGP.

Figure 1 summarizes the process of CGP, which uses single assays to evaluate cancer biomarkers. The information provided by these evaluations is then used to match patients to the best possible treatment and therapies for their specific conditions (Illumina).

There has also been development in treating genetic diseases. Precision medicine opens up the possibility of genetic libraries, which are databases storing information about different individuals' genomes. The knowledge offered by the patient’s genome, related symptoms, and access to similarly diseased individuals' genomes allows researchers to make more accurate and potentially quicker genetic diagnoses (Illumina).

Pharmacogenomics, the study of the relationship between a patient's genetics to medication (as portrayed in the figure below), lastly plays an important role in precision medicine. This analysis provides more insight into gene-drug interactions, allowing researchers to develop and distribute more effective treatments.

### Prevention
Precision medicine can also be applied toward identifying the genetic risks of a patient for disease. With the increasing availability of genetic libraries, there is vast access to both the history of individuals with various diseases, as well as hereditary information which can be used to calculate any risk a patient may have for disease or cancer (Illumina).

Another application is NIPT, or non-invasive prenatal genetics.

Figure 4, above, illustrates how researchers can access information of unborn babies, as their DNA is found in the mother’s bloodstream. By doing so, they can determine the health of the baby, potential risks, and necessary treatments, all without disturbing the baby or their development process (Illumina).

The applications of precision medicine are lastly evident in the present day with the COVID-19 pandemic. Health experts have developed an intricate genomic surveillance process which allows them and the public to be more informed about the speed of which pathogens are mutating and spreading. Such information allows public health officials to develop plans for preventing transmission and infection on an individual and national scale (Zhou, et al.). This particular application for public health requires a more external approach of precision medicine, as factors extend past patients' genetics and into their environment.


## Examples of Precision Medicine
### Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
Duchenne muscular dystrophy, abbreviated DMD, is a progressive, degenerative muscle disease caused by a mutation in a protein called dystrophin. When properly functioning, dystrophin works to strengthen muscle fibers and protect from impact (Kostek).

**Figure 5:** Diagram of muscular structure impacted by DMD (*Source - MASS4D*)

According to the 2019 study "Precision Medicine and Exercise Therapy in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy" by Matthew Kostek (doi: 10.3390/sports7030064), there is no specific cure known for DMD. However, precision medicine has enabled two main treatments: exercise or genetic modifiers. These genetic modifiers include dystrophin integration or exon skipping, where scientists can alter mRNA splicing to skip over the mutated exon and thus allow dystrophin to retain its proper function. 

Depending on individual genetics, physical build, or environmental factors, precision medicine can help determine whether a patient should focus more on physical training or gene therapies.


### CAR-T Cell Targeting
T-cells are critical components of the immune system which attack specific foreign antigens (NIH). CAR-T cell therapy utilizes T-cells that have been modified to recognize cancer cells. T-cells from the patient are modified by the addition of a gene which allows T-cells to bind to specific antigens on the cells for immune system targeting. One issue, however, is that these modified T-cells can cause issues throughout the body and often do not penetrate deep tissue, including those in tumors.

Dr. Yingxiao Wang's lab at UCSD published a paper in 2021 discussing the control of such CAR-T cell activation within tumors using ultrasound. By utilizing a promoter for a heat-shock protein to control the CAR cassette, Dr. Wang's lab was able to induce CAR-T activation in localized regions due to ultrasound's capability to target specific areas.

This development has major implications in cancer treatment due to the localization and personalization of CAR-T therapy for a patient. Additionally, its high efficacy rate and low damage rates due to the localization that ultrasound provides add to its appeal as a therapeutic option. While potentially expensive and not a fully medically-realized technology, this ultrasound CAR-T cell targeted therapy is a bleeding-edge rendition of precision medicine: both precise in targeting, and precise in its application for individuals. 

## Future
With the ever-developing field of biotechnology and its relationship with official medicine practices, precision medicine grows increasingly relevant in both present day and future.

### Solving Current Issues
In the future, precision medicine will continue to offer solutions to many current issues. This includes minimizing unnecessary and often high costs of drugs or treatments which are less effective than the personalized therapeutics developed from this approach. New data acquisition methods will make precision medicine more accessible and therefore affordable, including the development of large, comprehensive patient platforms. Building and refining these databases can help predict patient predisposition to certain diseases or cancers with more accuracy and speed than before (Illumina).

### Problems
As with most technology, precision medicine is not without challenges. First, this approach can be costly, as sequencing and learning about the entire genomes of individuals comes at an expense due to the quantity of genomes being sequenced. Although genome sequencing has greatly improved in efficiency and affordability, individual sequencing and utilizing these new technologies still comes at a cost (MedlinePlus). 

Similarly, health care costs will also increase, as the root of precision medicine lies in researchers, scientists, and healthcare professionals examining individual factors of each patient. Personalizing healthcare increases the value of the healthcare at a cost to the patient (MedlinePlus).

The issue of ethics has also become more relevant, as patients' privacy and confidentiality during the process of personalizing medicine has come into question. Lastly, since precision medicine represents an entirely new sector in medicine, high logistical rearrangement is needed. This includes developing new technology, increasing access to this technology, expanding education (particularly for biochemistry and molecular genetics), and training professionals on new procedures (MedlinePlus).

Despite these obstacles, however, the value of precision medicine in improving the quality and duration of life will make it relevant and significant for years to come. At its very core, medicine aims to prioritize life, and precision medicine has proven to be a valuable tool for doing so.
